    <p>Friday, January 1, 2021: A podcast is born. As a podcast listener, don't you love being
        able to drop insightful and relevant knowledge bombs into everyday conversations? How many
        times have you taken a mundane chitchat session into the intellectual stratosphere with a 
        phrase that started with: "So, I heard an interesting podcast the other day on that topic..."
    </p>
    <p>This new podcast has been engineered from the ground up to provide you with that kind of ammunition
        on a daily basis. Every single day, I will be bringing you a podcast with 100% factually accurate content
        that is 100% relevant to every living person on the planet. I guarantee that you'll use this information
        multiple times per day. You don't have to mention my podcast by name in your day-to-day interactions, 
        but if you could smash that Like and Subscribe button </p>
